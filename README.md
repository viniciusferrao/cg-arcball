This is an assignment for Computer Graphics course.

It consists of a 3D space with random generated boxes with the ability to translate and rotate using quaternions. The modelling of the objects is done with an arcball. You can either do rotation and translation with a single generated box or with the entire scene.

There are no instructions, the only needed knowledge is that a double click on the mouse, or any other pointer device, will change between translation and rotation modes. When rotation is enabled an arcball will be drawn to orient the user.

To run it, just clone this repository and open index.html on your browser.

Live version of this code is available [here](http://www.if.ufrj.br/~ferrao/cg/arcball).
